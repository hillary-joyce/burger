# Donut Devour

Donut Devour is a full-stack MySQL app that allows you to create and list new donut flavors, which are then saved in a database. Users can then "devour" the donuts, moving them into the devoured column.

## Getting Started

head over to the [Heroku Page](https://blooming-sea-57049.herokuapp.com/)to get started.

To the left you see a list of dounuts to be devoured, and to the right are donuts that have been devoured.

To add a new donut, scroll down to the "add donut" input and add any donut you like (Pizza Bacon Ranch? Peppermint Greek Yogurt? It's up to you!)

Once you submit your donut, it will be added to the donuts list. If you want to devour that donut, simply click the devour button.

And your donut is moved to the devoured column.
